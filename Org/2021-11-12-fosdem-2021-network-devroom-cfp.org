We are excited to announce that the call for proposals is now open for the
Network devroom at [[https://fosdem.org/2022/][FOSDEM 2022]]. FOSDEM is a free event for engineers to meet,
share ideas and collaborate. FOSDEM is one of the largest events of its kind,
hosting, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over
the world.

Please note that, due to Covid-19, FOSDEM will be held virtually again next year
on the 5th and 6th of February, 2022. All presentations will be pre-recorded
with live chat during each presentation and live Q&A after each presentation.

** About the devroom

The FOSDEM Network devroom hosts a diversity of talks covering open source
networking projects and technologies. The scope of the Network devroom is broad
and targets those software developers engaged in network design, monitoring,
management and software development with open source tools.

We typically host a variety of talks on Networking topics including:
 - Network monitoring (inventory, discovery & telemetry),
 - Network management (enterprise, carrier-grade, cloud, IoT)
 - Networking protocols (the full alphabet soup)
 - Security (IPS, IDS, protocols)
 - Authentication
 - Development tools (libraries, SDKs, plugins)
 - Network stacks 


** Suggested Topics:

If it moves network packets, monitors, or interacts with, or supervises entities
that moves network packets, it is likely a topic the devroom is interested in. A
very /non-exhaustive/ list of the projects and topics we would love to see on
the schedule are:

| Monitoring  | Nagios, Icinga2, Naemon, NTop, SNAS, Graphana, Prometheus, collectd |
| Frameworks  | DPDK, eBPF, XDP, FD.io, PANDA                                       |
| Switching   | Snabb, OpenvSwitch, Tungsten Fabric, Lagopus, FastClick             |
| Stacks      | Linux, *BSD, F-Stack                                                |
| Controllers | Istio, Envoy, Network Service Mesh, OpenDayLight, Calico, Contiv    |
| Edge        | Akraino, Openness                                                   |
| Routing     | FRRouting, BIRD, Go-BGP                                             |
| Management  | ONAP, Ganglia, NetSNMP, PNDA.io                                     |
| Security    | Suricata, Snort                                                     |
| Tooling     | VSPerf, TRex, Moongen, Scapy, Warp17                                |


Talks should be aimed at a technical audience, but should not assume that
attendees are already familiar with your project or how it solves a given
problem. Talk proposals may cover very specific solutions to a problem, or may
be a higher level project overview for lesser known projects.

** Code of Conduct

[[https://fosdem.org/2022/practical/conduct/][FOSDEM Code of Conduct]]:

We'd like to remind all speakers and attendees that all of the presentations and
discussions in our devroom are held under the guidelines set in the CoC and we
expect attendees, speakers, and volunteers to follow the CoC at all times.

If you submit a proposal and it is accepted, you will be required to confirm
that you accept the FOSDEM CoC. If you have any questions about the CoC or wish
to have one of the devroom organizers review your presentation slides or any
other content for CoC compliance, please email us and we will do our best to
assist you.
