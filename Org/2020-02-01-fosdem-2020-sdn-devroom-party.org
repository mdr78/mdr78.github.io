[[https://archive.fosdem.org/2020][FOSDEM '20]] just before Covid hit Europe in 2020, was a pretty amazing
experience. It felt almost as the calm before the coming storm, if it is
possible to call FOSDEM calm.

Ordinarly we'd get the speakers from SDN devroom together for a couple of beers
at the [[https://mannekenpiscafe.be/eng.html][Manneken Pis Caf√©]] after the conference, but was to be a special year. The
Manneken Pis was being renovated but, thanks to some amazing work from [[https://monjalon.net/][Thomas
Monjalon]] we landed in the [[https://roydespagne.be/fr/index.php][Roy D'Espange]] instead, it was awesome!

As always thanks to all the speakers and Charles Eckel, Emma Foley and Thomas for
all the hard work, great photos from the night below.
