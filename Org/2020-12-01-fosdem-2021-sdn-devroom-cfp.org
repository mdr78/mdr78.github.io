We are pleased to announce the Call for Participation for the FOSDEM 2021
Software Defined Networking devroom! FOSDEM is a free event for software
developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate.

   - FOSDEM is free to attend. There is no registration.
   - FOSDEM [[http://www.fosdem.org/][website]] 
   - FOSDEM [[https://fosdem.org/2021/practical/conduct/][code of conduct]]

**Please feel free to forward this CFP to anyone you think may be interested.**

** New rules / what changes since last year
For obvious reasons, this year the event will not take place in a physical
location but online.

   - The reference time will be Brussels local lime (CET).
   - Talks will be pre-recorded in advance, and streamed during the event
   - Q/A session will be live
   - A facility will be provided for people watching to chat between themselves
   - A facility will be provided for people watching to submit questions
   - Clearly the venue will be more comfortable this year, please don't expect
     this level of service every year!

** Important Dates

|  | Submission deadline            |
|  | Announcement of selected talks |
|  | Presentations upload deadline  |
|  | Conference dates (online)      |
|  | SDN devroom date (online)      |

Talks covering any projects or technologies within the networking domain are
welcome, with the only condition being that the project or technology must be
free and open source. The SDN devroom team are asking contributors to make a
special effort to attend, present, contribute and discuss at this years FOSDEM.
Please accept our apologies for the relative lateness of this CFP, there is a
huge amount of work going on behind the scenes to make this years FOSDEM
happen.

moves network packets, it is likely a topic the devroom is interested in. This

Talks should be aimed at a technical audience, but should not assume that
attendees are already familiar with your project or how it solves a given
problem. Talk proposals may cover very specific solutions to a problem, or may
be a higher level project overview for lesser known projects.

** Proposals:

Proposals should be made through the FOSDEM Pentabarf submission tool. You do
not need to create a new Pentabarf account if you already have one from a past
year. \\
