The SDN devroom team are asking people to make a special effort to attend,
present, contribute and discuss at FOSDEM 2021.   

Talks covering any projects or technologies within the networking domain are
welcome, with the only condition being that the project or technology must be
free and open source. Software Defined Networking continues to be an exciting
and growing field and FOSDEM gives a unique opportunity to reach a large
audience of knowledgeable, highly technical, free and open source software
activists.


# Topics:

If it moves network packets, or interacts with, or supervises entities that
moves network packets, it is likely a topic we are interested in. This year the
devroom topics will include the following fields.

Talks should be aimed at a technical audience, but should not assume that
attendees are already familiar with your project or how it solves a given
problem. Talk proposals may cover very specific solutions to a problem, or may
be a higher level project overview for lesser known projects.

not need to create a new Pentabarf account if you already have one from a past
year.
