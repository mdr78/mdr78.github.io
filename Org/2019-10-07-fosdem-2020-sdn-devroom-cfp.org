We are pleased to announce the Call for Participation for the FOSDEM 2020
Software Defined Networking devroom!

Important dates:

| Nov 24th 2019 | Submission deadline for talk proposals |
| Dec 15th 2019 | Announcement of the final schedule     |
| Feb 1st 2019  | Software Defined Networking devroom    |

Talks covering any projects or technologies within the networking domain are
welcome, with the only condition being that the project or technology must be
free and open source. Software Defined Networking continues to be an exciting
and growing field and FOSDEM gives an opportunity to reach a large audience of
knowledgeable, highly technical, free and open source software activists.

** Topics:

This year the devroom topics will include the following fields.

| Domain         | IoT, Cloud, Enterprise, Service Provider, Wireless and Cellular.                         |
| Physical       | low power, mesh, high throughput, low latency, optical, wireless                         |
| Infrastructure | switching, routing, load balancing, translation, authentic, crypto, detection, intercept |
| Tooling        | libraries, frameworks, tracing, debugging, domain specific languages and extensions.     |
| Telemetry      | counters & statistics, interference, analysis, automation.                               |
| Validation     | performance, latency, packet manipulation & fuzzing, traffic generators.                 |
| Orchestration  | management, network-layer plugins and controllers.                                       |

This year the devroom will focus on cloud infrastructure, and the challenges of
scaling and resiliency posed by cloud deployments - what does it take to build a
fast and robust cloud native network? What does this mean in the age of
edge cloud?

see on the schedule are:

Talks should be aimed at a technical audience, but should not assume that
attendees are already familiar with your project or how it solves a given
problem. Talk proposals may cover very specific solutions to a problem, or may
be a higher level project overview for lesser known projects.

** Proposals:

Proposals should be made through the FOSDEM Pentabarf submission tool. You do
not need to create a new Pentabarf account if you already have one from a past
year.
