title: SSL Tunnelling with nmap-ncat on Fedora 30

#+END_EXPORT

Consistent with the laws of un-intended consequences, when I upgraded to Fedora
30 to play with the new versions of CLang and GCC, something broke git.

More precisely, netcat which I use to traverse our corporate firewall, kept
failing with /"Ncat: Network is unreachable"/. The network /is/ reachable,
through the proxy, so whats the problem?

On closer inspection I found that the venerable [[https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/MJOCCQGUY7PYL3G42JJA6JKRLMQ2YXBN/][nc had been silently replaced by
nmap ncat]]. Although their executable names are the same, they are not completely
command line compatible.

With nc you would have configured your .ssh/config for a SOCKS 5 proxy as
follows.
#+begin_src
Host gerrit.fd.io
    ProxyCommand nc -x proxy.corporate.com:5000 %h %p
#+end_src

These should now be re-configured as follows.
#+begin_src
Host gerrit.fd.io
    ProxyCommand nc --proxy proxy.corporate.com:5000 --proxy-type socks5 %h %p
#+end_src
