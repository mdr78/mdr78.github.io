As I was adding more content to my blog, it was starting to feel messy and
adding tags seemed like the obvious solution. What started out as a simple
project to add tags to my blog, ended up in a more substantial rework to improve
the look-and-feel, structure and add tags.

All kudos belongs to Peter Roelants from whom I am borrowing heavily, as I am
not a web frontend developer. You can find all the detail on his [[https://peterroelants.github.io/posts/adding-tags-to-github-pages/][blog]]. This
meant revisiting all my previous posts to add tags, but it was worth the effort.
