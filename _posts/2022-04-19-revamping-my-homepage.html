As I was adding more content to my blog, it was starting to feel messy and<br />
adding tags seemed like the obvious solution. What started out as a simple<br />
project to add tags to my blog, ended up in a more substantial rework to improve<br />
the look-and-feel, structure and add tags.<br />
</p>

<p>
All kudos belongs to Peter Roelants from whom I am borrowing heavily, as I am<br />
not a web frontend developer. You can find all the detail on his <a href="https://peterroelants.github.io/posts/adding-tags-to-github-pages/">blog</a>. This<br />
meant revisiting all my previous posts to add tags, but I think it was worth the<br />
effort.<br />
