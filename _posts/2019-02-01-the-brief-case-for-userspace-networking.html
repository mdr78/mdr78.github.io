I wrote a <a href="https://www.fosdem.org">FOSDEM 2019</a> lighting talk on <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/userspace_network_stacks/">the brief case for userspace networking</a>.<br />
The talk briefly describes the rationale, origins and ecosystem of userspace<br />
networking tooling such as DPDK, FD.io VPP and similar tools. Having been<br />
involved with most of them since their inception, I thought that I was well<br />
placed to discuss this. I was pretty pleased with the final presentation.<br />
</p>

<p>
I think what was on my mind, what I was responding to in my own way, was to<br />
degrees of hositility I had experienced towards to these tools and their<br />
communities over the years, that I never really understood. Terms like 'kernel<br />
bypass networking' carried negatives connotations that I didn't agree with and<br />
that bothered me. For me, open source is the eternal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">bazaar</a>, and that means that<br />
some degree of duplication is always inevitable in order for innovation to take<br />
place. Although I do understand, why it can cause friction at times.<br />
</p>

<p>
The willingness to fork, and try something in a new and different way, is open<br />
source's great asset and the reason while open source solutions usually prevail.<br />
Userspace networking has been enabling this model for engineers writing network<br />
functions for the past 10+ years. <a href="https://ebpf.io/">eBPF</a> is doing a remarkable job enabling the<br />
same for kernel based networking today.<br />
</p>

<p>
When I had to leave FOSDEM early, the talk itself was relegated to the graveyard<br />
shift, but it lives on <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/userspace_network_stacks/">online</a>.<br />
