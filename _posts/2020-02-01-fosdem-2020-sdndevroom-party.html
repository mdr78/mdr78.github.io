<p>
<a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2020">FOSDEM '20</a> just before Covid hit Europe in 2020, was a pretty amazing<br />
experience. It felt almost as the calm before the coming storm, if it is<br />
possible to call FOSDEM calm.<br />
</p>

<p>
Ordinarly we'd get the speakers from SDN devroom together for a couple of beers<br />
at the <a href="https://mannekenpiscafe.be/eng.html">Manneken Pis Caf√©</a> after the conference, but was to be a special year. The<br />
Manneken Pis was being renovated but, thanks to some amazing work from <a href="https://monjalon.net/">Thomas<br />
Monjalon</a> we landed in the <a href="https://roydespagne.be/fr/index.php">Roy D'Espange</a> instead, it was awesome!<br />
</p>

<p>
As always thanks to all the speakers and Charles Eckel, Emma Foley and Thomas for<br />
all the hard work, great photos from the night below.<br />
