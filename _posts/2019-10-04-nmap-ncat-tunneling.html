title: Tunnelling through SOCKS 5 Proxy on Fedora 30 and above
---

<p>
Consistent with the laws of un-intended consequences, when I upgraded to Fedora
30 to play with the new versions of CLang and GCC, something broke git.
</p>

<p>
More precisely, netcat which I use to traverse our corporate firewall, kept
failing with <i>"Ncat: Network is unreachable"</i>. The network <i>is</i> reachable, whats
the problem?
</p>

<p>
On closer inspection I found that the venerable <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/MJOCCQGUY7PYL3G42JJA6JKRLMQ2YXBN/">nc had been silently replaced by
nmap ncat</a>. Although their executable names are the same, they are not completely
compatible.
</p>

<p>
With nc you would have configured your .ssh/config for a SOCKS 5 proxy as
follows.
</p>
<pre class="example">
Host gerrit.fd.io
    ProxyCommand nc -x proxy.corporate.com:5000 %h %p
</pre>

<p>
These should now be re-configured as follows.
</p>
<pre class="example">
Host gerrit.fd.io
    ProxyCommand nc --proxy proxy.corporate.com:5000 --proxy-type socks5 %h %p
</pre>
